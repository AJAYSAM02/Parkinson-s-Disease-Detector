##ABOUT PARKINSON'S DISEASE:
Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disorder of the central nervous system affecting movement and inducing tremors and stiffness. It has 5 stages to it and affects more than 1 million individuals every year in India. This is chronic and has no cure yet. It is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.

This is a model to accurately detect the presence of Parkinson’s disease in an individual. We have used libraries like scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, and xgboost, we have built a model using an XGBClassifier.
we’ll load the dataset provided and get the features and labels.
we will then scale the features.
we will then split the dataset into training and test dataset.
we build an XGBClassifier and then calculate the accuracy of our model.

##WHAT IS XGBOOST?
XGBoost(eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is a new Machine Learning algorithm designed with speed and performance and is based on decision trees. We have imported the XGBClassifier from the xgboost library.
