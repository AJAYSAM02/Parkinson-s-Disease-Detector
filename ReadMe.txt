This is a model to accurately detect the presence of Parkinson’s disease in an individual. We have used libraries like scikit-learn, numpy, pandas, and xgboost, we have built a model using an XGBClassifier.
we’ll load the dataset provided and get the features and labels.
we will then scale the features.
we will then split the dataset into training and test dataset.
we build an XGBClassifier and then calculate the accuracy of our model.

XGBoost(eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is a new Machine Learning algorithm designed with speed and performance and is based on decision trees. We have imported the XGBClassifier from the xgboost library.
